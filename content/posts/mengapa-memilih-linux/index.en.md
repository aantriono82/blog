This article discusses the reasons for migrating from Windows to Linux.

# My Journey from Windows to Linux  

It‚Äôs been 3 years since I started using Linux as my primary operating system for everyday work. It all began from the realization of the risks and ethical concerns of using **pirated** or **cracked** software on Windows.

Through learning, both physically and digitally, and interacting with various Linux communities across the internet and Telegram, I was motivated to migrate from Windows to Linux. That‚Äôs when I decided to take Linux seriously.

Ubuntu was the first Linux distribution I tried. There was a **different feeling** seeing a desktop that looked unfamiliar compared to Windows. My curiosity grew instantly ‚Äî many questions appeared that needed answers. Exploring deeper, I found **LibreOffice** as the default office suite, including Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, and Base.

Was it difficult to use Linux applications at first? Of course ‚Äî anything new requires **adaptation and patience**. üòÑ

As a new Linux user, I experienced what‚Äôs called **‚Äúdistro hopping.‚Äù** This term refers to the habit of frequently switching between Linux distributions in a short period. Some of the distros I‚Äôve tried include:

* Debian  
* Ubuntu  
* MX Linux  
* Antix  
* Deepin  
* Arch  
* Endeavour  
* Mabox  
* Langit Ketujuh  
* Garuda  
* Fedora  

I also had a chance to try Unix-based systems such as:  

* FreeBSD  
* GhostBSD  

Even though I‚Äôve switched between many distros, my Linux skill level‚Ä¶ well, still about the same üòÖ  

Here‚Äôs a look at the desktop from the Linux distro I currently use. Guess which one?

## It‚Äôs Free  

Linux is completely **free**. You don‚Äôt need to pay for any license, except for enterprise editions like **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** or **SUSE Linux Enterprise**.

Unlike Windows, Linux doesn‚Äôt bother you with ‚ÄúActivate Windows‚Äù messages or require pirated patches that could contain malware.  

---

## More Secure  

Every OS has its vulnerabilities, but Linux is known as one of the **most secure operating systems**.  

Windows systems are notorious for being targeted by malware and viruses, while Linux is inherently more secure ‚Äî not invincible, but **much harder to exploit**.  

Linux‚Äôs package management, repository-based software system, and permission model all contribute to its strong security. You don‚Äôt even need antivirus software in most cases, saving money and resources.  

---

## Open Source  

Using a closed-source OS is like buying a car but never being allowed to open the hood. With Linux, you can see everything under the hood ‚Äî it‚Äôs **fully open source**.  

Even if most users won‚Äôt read the source code, the openness ensures **transparency and trust**. Developers can inspect, modify, and improve Linux freely.  

---

## Lightweight on Low-End Hardware  

As operating systems evolve, hardware requirements also increase dramatically. For example, Windows 10 or 11 needs at least **8 GB of RAM** for smooth performance, ideally 16 GB.  

In contrast, Linux can run smoothly on **older or low-spec computers**. Many lightweight distros like **Xubuntu, Lubuntu, or MX Linux** can revive old machines efficiently.  

---

## Highly Customizable  

Customization is one of Linux‚Äôs biggest strengths. If you love to tweak your desktop‚Äôs look and feel, Linux is the best choice.  

Different desktop environments offer unique experiences:  

- **GNOME** ‚Äì simple, elegant, and modern.  
- **KDE Plasma** ‚Äì extremely customizable and full of features.  
- **Cinnamon, Budgie, Xfce** ‚Äì great alternatives for different preferences.  

You can even apply new icon themes, widgets, and wallpapers ‚Äî or use **Conky** to display real-time system info right on your desktop.  

---

## Perfect for Programmers  

Linux supports almost every major programming language (Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, etc.) and provides built-in development tools.  

The **Linux terminal** is far more powerful than Windows‚Äô command prompt. Package managers like `apt` and `dnf` make software installation effortless.  

Moreover, Linux has built-in **SSH support**, ideal for managing servers. That‚Äôs why most developers and DevOps professionals prefer Linux-based environments.  

---

## Built-in ‚ÄúApp Store‚Äù  

Installing software on Linux is easy thanks to **Software Centers** (like GNOME Software or KDE Discover).  

Most apps you‚Äôll ever need are available directly from official repositories. Modern distros also support **Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage**, making software installation consistent and reliable.  

---

## Many Distributions to Choose From  

Unlike Windows, Linux isn‚Äôt just one OS ‚Äî it‚Äôs a whole family of **distributions (distros)** tailored to different needs.  

- Security testing? Try **Kali Linux**.  
- Programming? Try **Ubuntu** or **Fedora**.  
- Old hardware? Try **Puppy Linux** or **Lubuntu**.  

There‚Äôs a Linux distro for everyone.

## Reliability  

Windows tends to slow down over time, sometimes requiring a full reinstall. Linux, however, remains fast and stable for years.  

You rarely need to reboot Linux, except for kernel updates. With Windows, almost every small change requires a restart ‚Äî install software, uninstall, update, reboot!  

That‚Äôs why Linux powers most of the world‚Äôs **web servers, supercomputers, and tech giants** like Google and Facebook.  

---

## Supportive Community  

You don‚Äôt need to hire a technician to fix Linux problems. The Linux community is incredibly active and helpful.  

Just search forums, ask on Telegram groups, Reddit, or StackExchange ‚Äî and you‚Äôll likely get friendly, detailed help for free.  

---

## Conclusion  

Those were my **reasons for switching from Windows to Linux** as my main operating system.  

Sure, Linux still has limitations ‚Äî mainly with certain proprietary apps or games ‚Äî but support is growing fast. More developers are creating native Linux versions every year.  

If you‚Äôre curious, give Linux a try. You might just find your own reasons to stay.

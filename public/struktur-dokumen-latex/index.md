# LaTeX Document Structure


This article discusses LaTeX document structure for letter, article, report, and book document classes.

## 1. Introduction

**LaTeX** is a markup-based typesetting system widely used for writing scientific works, reports, books, and theses.  
One popular platform for writing and composing LaTeX documents is **Overleaf**, an online editor that enables real-time collaboration and provides complete documentation and templates.

Before starting document writing, it's important to understand the basic structure of LaTeX documents.  
A `.tex` file generally consists of three main parts:

1. **Preamble** â€“ initial document settings before `\begin{document}`
2. **Body** â€“ main document content between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`
3. **Additional sections** â€“ such as appendices, bibliography, or index

---

## 2. General Structure of LaTeX Documents

The minimal structure of a LaTeX document is as follows:
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\title{Document Title}
\author{Author Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
Your introduction text here.

\end{document}
```

Overleaf explains that every LaTeX document **must begin** with a `\documentclass{}` declaration and end with `\end{document}`.  

---

## 3. Preamble

The preamble contains all initial settings before the document begins. It typically includes:

### a. Document Class
```latex
\documentclass[12pt, a4paper]{article}
```

The document class determines the type and general style of the document.  
Some standard classes:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `article` | For articles, short reports, or papers |
| `report` | For long reports, final projects, or dissertations |
| `book` | For books with chapters |
| `letter` | For formal letters |

---

### b. Packages

Packages extend LaTeX's capabilities.  
Common examples:
```latex
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}   % Set text encoding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}      % Set font encoding
\usepackage{graphicx}         % Insert images
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb} % Mathematical symbols and formulas
```

---

### c. Document Metadata

Metadata contains information such as title, author, and date.
```latex
\title{LaTeX Document Example}
\author{Author Name}
\date{\today} % or can be left empty with {}
```

This metadata is used when the `\maketitle` command is called in the document body.

---

## 4. Document Body

This section contains the main content between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`.

Example basic structure:
```latex
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Opening or introductory section of the topic.

\section{Methodology}
Explaining research methods or steps.

\subsection{Steps}
More detailed explanation of the method.

\section{Conclusion}
Final conclusion of the discussion.

\end{document}
```

### a. Section Numbering

LaTeX automatically numbers sections (`\section`, `\subsection`, etc.).  
For unnumbered sections, use an asterisk:
```latex
\section*{Acknowledgments}
```

---

### b. Adding Images

Use the `graphicx` package:
```latex
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png}
\caption{Example Image}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
```

---

### c. Writing Formulas and Equations

Use the `amsmath` package:
```latex
\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}
```

---

## 5. Additional Sections (Optional)

For academic documents or books, LaTeX provides additional divisions such as:

### a. Frontmatter, Mainmatter, and Backmatter
```latex
\frontmatter    % For front matter (abstract, table of contents)
\tableofcontents

\mainmatter     % Main content (chapters, subchapters)
\chapter{Introduction}

\backmatter     % Back matter (bibliography, appendices)
\appendix
\chapter{Appendix}
```

---

### b. Bibliography

Use `biblatex` for automatic bibliography:
```latex
\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}

...

\printbibliography
```

---

## 6. Minimal Document Example

Here's an example of the **simplest** valid document:
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\title{Hello World in LaTeX}
\author{Author}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is a minimal document example in LaTeX.

\end{document}
```

---

## 7. Tips and Best Practices

- Use **separate folder structure** (`/images`, `/chapters`, `/bib`) to make large documents easier to manage.  
- Separate each chapter into `.tex` files and call them with `\input{}` or `\include{}`.  
- Use the **Overleaf Outline Panel** to quickly view document structure.  
- Avoid loading excessive unnecessary packages to maintain compilation performance.

## 8. Conclusion

The basic structure of LaTeX documents is highly organized and modular.  
By understanding the division between **preamble**, **body**, and **additional sections**, writers can manage technical documents more efficiently.  

Overleaf provides complete guides, practical examples, and templates that make it easier for new users to learn and write professional documents.

## A Brief Overview of LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation (typesetting) system designed to produce professional-quality text layouts.  
It is widely used in academia, science, and publishing because it handles complex structures such as:

- Mathematical formulas and scientific symbols  
- Automatic citations and bibliographies  
- Consistent and clean document layouts

To run LaTeX, you need a *TeX distribution* — a complete package containing all the components needed to write, compile, and format your document.  
The three most commonly used distributions are **MiKTeX** (Windows), **MacTeX** (macOS), and **TeX Live** (cross-platform).

---

## What Is a LaTeX Distribution?

A LaTeX distribution is a collection of software that provides:

- **TeX engines** such as pdfTeX, XeTeX, or LuaTeX  
- **Package manager** for downloading and updating packages  
- **Font collections and document styles**  
- **Compilers** to convert `.tex` files into `.pdf`  
- **Built-in editors** (optional) for writing LaTeX code

In short, a LaTeX distribution is the foundation you need to write and compile documents seamlessly.

## Installing MiKTeX (Windows)

### Step 1: Download the Installer

{{< image src="miktex.png" caption="MiKTeX Homepage" height="1562" width="2400">}}

1. Go to [https://miktex.org/download](https://miktex.org/download)  
2. Choose the **Windows** version  
3. Download the installer (recommended: **MiKTeX-pdfTeX Installer**)  
4. File size is approximately 200 MB

### Step 2: Run the Installer
1. Double-click the installer file  
2. Choose *“Install just for me”* (no admin rights needed)  
3. Follow the installation wizard until completion

### Step 3: Set Preferences
- **Install missing packages on-the-fly** → select *Yes*  
- **Paper size** → choose *A4*  
- Click *Start* to begin installation

### Step 4: Verify Installation
Open **Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
pdflatex --version
```
If MiKTeX version information appears, installation was successful.

### Step 5: Update Packages
1. Open **MiKTeX Console**  
2. Click **Updates → Check for updates → Update now**

## Installing MacTeX (macOS)

### Step 1: Download the Package

{{< image src="mactex.png" caption="MacTeX Homepage" height="1562" width="2400">}}

- Visit [https://www.tug.org/mactex/](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)  
- Download **MacTeX.pkg** (~4 GB)  
- For a lightweight version, choose **BasicTeX** (~100 MB)

### Step 2: Installation Process
1. Double-click `MacTeX.pkg`  
2. Follow the on-screen instructions  
3. Enter the admin password if required  
4. Wait 10–20 minutes until the process finishes

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
pdflatex --version
```
The output will show the pdfTeX version from TeX Live.

### Step 4: Update Packages
Use **TeX Live Utility**, then select *Update All Packages*.

### Step 5: Launch TeXShop
- Installed automatically with MacTeX  
- Location: `Applications/TeX/TeXShop.app`  
- A user-friendly editor for macOS users

## Installing TeX Live on Linux

### Method 1: Using the Package Manager (Recommended)

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S texlive-most
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation (Advanced Users)
```bash
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-*/
sudo perl install-tl
```

Then, add PATH configuration to `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2024/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
```

Reload the shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Installing a LaTeX Editor (Optional but Recommended)

| **Editor** | **Platform** | **Key Features** |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **TeXstudio** | Windows, macOS, Linux | Full-featured, PDF integration, auto-completion |
| **Overleaf** | Online | Real-time collaboration, no installation |
| **VS Code + LaTeX Workshop** | Cross-platform | Modern, flexible, Git integration |
| **TeXworks** | Bundled | Lightweight and beginner-friendly |
| **LyX** | Windows, macOS, Linux | Word-like interface (WYSIWYM) |

## Testing Your Installation

Create a file named `test.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}

\title{LaTeX Test Document}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is my first LaTeX document.

\section{Sample Formula}
Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]
\end{document}
```

Compile it via terminal:
```bash
pdflatex test.tex
```
Or compile directly from your editor (e.g., press **F5** in TeXstudio).  
If `test.pdf` is generated, your system is ready to use.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|------------|---------------|
| Package not found | Enable *auto-install* (MiKTeX) or run `tlmgr install <package-name>` (TeX Live) |
| `pdflatex` command not recognized | Ensure PATH is set correctly and restart the terminal |
| Font errors | Run `sudo fc-cache -fv` on Linux or reinstall MiKTeX on Windows |
| Compilation failed | Check the `.log` file for details and ensure all packages are installed |

---

## Tips & Recommendations

### For Beginners:
- Use **MiKTeX + TeXstudio** (Windows)  
- Use **MacTeX + TeXShop** (macOS)  
- Use **TeX Live + TeXstudio** (Linux)

### For Advanced Users:
- Choose **TeX Live** for cross-platform consistency  
- Use **VS Code + LaTeX Workshop**

In the Naruto anime series, there are several types of eye jutsu. Rinnegan and Sharingan are two of the three most dangerous Dōjutsu or eye techniques. Both are rare Kekkei Genkai that can only be possessed by specific individuals. Sharingan is the characteristic Dōjutsu of the Uchiha clan that allows its users to copy various techniques (jutsu) such as ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. Meanwhile, Rinnegan appears when the powers of Indra Otsutsuki and Asura Otsutsuki are combined. The main power of Rinnegan is the ability to master life and death — it can even extract a person’s soul in a matter of seconds.

Creates auxiliary files such as: .aux → for cross-references (\\ref, \\cite) .toc → for the table of contents .log → for error logs Produces the final output (.pdf or .dvi).

Knuth, a renowned computer scientist and professor emeritus at Stanford University. The idea to develop TeX emerged in the late 1970s when Knuth was dissatisfied with the print quality of his second book, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2. At that time, the publishing industry was transitioning from traditional typesetting technology (with metal) to digital photocomposition systems, which often produced low-quality output, especially for mathematical formulas. In 1977, Knuth began an ambitious project to create a digital typesetting system that could produce high-quality documents, especially for texts containing complex mathematical notation. His goal was to create a tool that was not only aesthetic but also flexible and could be used by technical writers without requiring deep graphic design expertise. This project resulted in TeX, a typesetting system designed to produce documents with high typographic precision.

The system was written in the SAIL programming language and ran on mainframe computers at Stanford. TeX was designed to provide high-level control over document layout, including spacing, fonts, and placement of elements such as mathematical formulas. One of TeX’s major innovations was the line-breaking algorithm, which ensured that text was arranged with optimal aesthetics, avoiding uneven spacing between words or overly dense lines.

This version, known as TeX82, became the standard used to this day. Knuth also ensured that TeX was open-source, allowing the community to develop and modify the system.

It all began from the realization of the risks and ethical concerns of using pirated or cracked software on Windows. Through learning, both physically and digitally, and interacting with various Linux communities across the internet and Telegram, I was motivated to migrate from Windows to Linux. That’s when I decided to take Linux seriously. Ubuntu was the first Linux distribution I tried. There was a different feeling seeing a desktop that looked unfamiliar compared to Windows. My curiosity grew instantly — many questions appeared that needed answers. Exploring deeper, I found LibreOffice as the default office suite, including Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, and Base. Was it difficult to use Linux applications at first? Of course — anything new requires adaptation and patience. 😄 As a new Linux user, I experienced what’s called “distro hopping.” This term refers to the habit of frequently switching between Linux distributions in a short period. Some of the distros I’ve tried include: Debian Ubuntu MX Linux Antix Deepin Arch Endeavour Mabox Langit Ketujuh Garuda Fedora I also had a chance to try Unix-based systems such as: FreeBSD GhostBSD Even though I’ve switched between many distros, my Linux skill level… well, still about the same 😅 Here’s a look at the desktop from the Linux distro I currently use.

A DE typically includes: File manager Icons and themes Wallpaper and widgets Panels and menus Built-in applications (e.g., text editor, calculator, media player, web browser) Most Linux distributions come in two main editions: Server (without GUI, command-line only) Desktop (with GUI provided by a DE) For example, Ubuntu Desktop ships with GNOME as its default DE. You can check which DE is currently running using: bash echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP Example output: text ubuntu:GNOME Without a DE, interaction is limited to the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Note This article is a copy from the Grav original page. If you want to know more comprehensively, please read the Markdown Syntax page. Writing content for the Web is tedious. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in messy code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits of Markdown are: Markdown is easy to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps content and visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

The main goal of this project was to create a completely free and open operating system. GNU stands for “GNU’s Not Unix,” indicating that the system is inspired by Unix but does not use Unix source code. The project successfully developed many important components such as a compiler (GCC), text editor (Emacs), and other system utilities. However, the GNU project still lacked a functional kernel. The Linux Kernel: In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a student from Finland, developed the Linux kernel as a personal project. This kernel was released under a free license, and over time, many developers contributed to perfecting it. The Linux kernel was then combined with GNU components to create a complete operating system known as GNU/Linux.

Some main characteristics of GNU/Linux include: Free and Open: GNU/Linux is open source software, meaning its source code is available to the public. Users can modify and redistribute this operating system according to their needs. Stability and Security: GNU/Linux is known for its high stability and security. The system rarely experiences crashes or virus attacks, making it a popular choice for servers and critical systems. Flexibility: GNU/Linux can run on various hardware, from personal computers, servers, to embedded devices such as routers and smartphones. Additionally, there are many Linux distributions (distros) that offer various configurations and user interfaces. Strong Community: GNU/Linux is supported by a global community consisting of developers, users, and organizations. This community actively contributes to development, documentation, and technical support.

They created a simple yet powerful multi-user and multitasking operating system. Unix’s design principles—simplicity, modularity, hierarchical file system—became the foundation for many subsequent OS developments. One of its key innovations was the “pipe”, which allowed the output of one program to be used as input for another, enhancing command-line flexibility. Unix evolved rapidly during the 1970s-1980s, adopted by universities, research institutions, and corporations. Its portability (thanks to being rewritten in C language) made it an industry standard. From Unix came many commercial variants (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX) as well as inspiration for open-source systems like BSD and Linux. Additionally, Unix gave birth to the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard, which ensures compatibility among modern operating systems.

One thing that distinguishes BSD from Linux is its licensing. The BSD License is more permissive compared to Linux’s GPL, allowing companies to adopt BSD code without having to open their modifications—the reason Apple chose BSD as the basis for macOS.

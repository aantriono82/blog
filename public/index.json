Both are rare Kekkei Genkai that can only be possessed by specific individuals. Sharingan is the characteristic D≈çjutsu of the Uchiha clan that allows its users to copy various techniques (jutsu) such as ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. Meanwhile, Rinnegan appears when the powers of Indra Otsutsuki and Asura Otsutsuki are combined.

Knuth, a renowned computer scientist and professor emeritus at Stanford University. The idea to develop TeX emerged in the late 1970s when Knuth was dissatisfied with the print quality of his second book, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2. At that time, the publishing industry was transitioning from traditional typesetting technology (with metal) to digital photocomposition systems, which often produced low-quality output, especially for mathematical formulas. In 1977, Knuth began an ambitious project to create a digital typesetting system that could produce high-quality documents, especially for texts containing complex mathematical notation. His goal was to create a tool that was not only aesthetic but also flexible and could be used by technical writers without requiring deep graphic design expertise. This project resulted in TeX, a typesetting system designed to produce documents with high typographic precision.

The system was written in the SAIL programming language and ran on mainframe computers at Stanford. TeX was designed to provide high-level control over document layout, including spacing, fonts, and placement of elements such as mathematical formulas. One of TeX‚Äôs major innovations was the line-breaking algorithm, which ensured that text was arranged with optimal aesthetics, avoiding uneven spacing between words or overly dense lines.

To address this, Knuth rewrote TeX in 1982 using the Pascal programming language and introduced the Metafont-based font system, which allowed for the creation of scalable digital fonts. This version, known as TeX82, became the standard used to this day. Knuth also ensured that TeX was open-source, allowing the community to develop and modify the system.

Note This article is a copy from the Grav original page. If you want to know more comprehensively, please read the Markdown Syntax page. Writing content for the Web is tedious. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in messy code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits of Markdown are: Markdown is easy to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it‚Äôs also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps content and visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown‚Äôs formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it‚Äôs been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown‚Äôs syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown‚Äôs syntax is the format of plain text email. ‚Äì John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

The Linux Kernel: In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a student from Finland, developed the Linux kernel as a personal project.

The system rarely experiences crashes or virus attacks, making it a popular choice for servers and critical systems. Flexibility: GNU/Linux can run on various hardware, from personal computers, servers, to embedded devices such as routers and smartphones.

One of its key innovations was the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù, which allowed the output of one program to be used as input for another, enhancing command-line flexibility. Unix evolved rapidly during the 1970s-1980s, adopted by universities, research institutions, and corporations. Its portability (thanks to being rewritten in C language) made it an industry standard. From Unix came many commercial variants (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX) as well as inspiration for open-source systems like BSD and Linux. Additionally, Unix gave birth to the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard, which ensures compatibility among modern operating systems.
